# razor-vshpere-hooks
This repo store the hooks used by a chat-ops workflow developed by EMC PacNW SEs.

Razor-server stores hook by default in /opt/razor/hooks for Ubuntu 14.04.

Ensure that Ruby 1.9.3 is installed on the razor-server then run `gem install rest-client`. This allows the razor-server to interact with REST apis.
